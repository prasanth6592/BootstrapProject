Planning Areas are areas of land, not less than one square mile, that share certain conditions, such as population density, infrastructure systems, level of development, or environmental sensitivity. Planning Areas do not necessarily coincide with municipal or county boundaries, but define geographic areas that are suitable for common application of public policy. The State Plan anticipates continued growth throughout New Jersey in all Planning Areas. The character, location and magnitude of this growth vary among Planning Areas according to the specific character of the area. Each Planning Area has Policy Objectives that guide growth in the context of its unique qualities and conditions. The Policy Objectives also shape and define the application of the Statewide Policies in each Planning Area. Refer to the NJSDRP for further description of the geographic nature of Planning Areas.",
